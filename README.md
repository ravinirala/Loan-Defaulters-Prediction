# Loan-Defaulters-Prediction
Machine Learning Project for predicting Loan Defaulters
- Applied Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering techniques to deal with outliers and missing values in preprocessing
- Classified the defaulters using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest. Random Forest model gave the
highest accuracy
- Applied K-Fold Cross Validation and GridSearchCV for obtaining best hyperparameters for model
